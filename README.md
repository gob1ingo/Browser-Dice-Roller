This is a little browser extension meant to simulate rolling dice commonly found in most table top board games. 

Initially this was just a test of Claude's coding abilities but has since turned into a little side project of mine. 

Instructions on how to get each version of this extension running on either firefox or chrome can be found in their respective folders within their README files.
